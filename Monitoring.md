Monitoring refers to the practice of continuously observing, collecting, and analyzing data about an application, system, or infrastructure to ensure its reliability, availability, and performance. Monitoring is a crucial aspect of DevOps because it provides real-time visibility into the health and behavior of software and infrastructure components, allowing teams to detect issues, troubleshoot problems, and make informed decisions to improve overall system performance and reliability.

Key aspects of monitoring in the DevOps world include:

1. Metrics Collection: 

    DevOps teams collect various types of metrics, including system metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, disk space), application-level metrics (response times, error rates, throughput), and business metrics (user engagement, conversion rates) to gain insights into system behavior.

2. Alerting: 

    Monitoring systems are configured to trigger alerts when predefined thresholds are breached or when specific events occur. These alerts notify teams about potential issues or anomalies, enabling them to respond proactively.

3. Visualization: 

    Monitoring data is often displayed on dashboards and charts for easy visualization. Tools like Grafana, Kibana, and Datadog provide customizable dashboards that help teams track system health and performance trends.

4. Logging: 

    Monitoring often involves collecting and analyzing log data generated by applications and infrastructure components. Centralized logging solutions (e.g., ELK Stack, Splunk) make it easier to search and analyze logs.

5. Tracing: 

    Distributed tracing allows teams to track requests as they flow through a complex, microservices-based architecture. Tools like Zipkin, Jaeger, and OpenTelemetry provide tracing capabilities.

6. Automation: 

    Automated monitoring processes, such as auto-scaling and self-healing, can respond to issues without human intervention. For example, an autoscaling group can automatically add more instances when traffic spikes.

7. Performance Optimization: 

    Monitoring helps identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Teams can use monitoring data to make informed decisions about code changes and infrastructure adjustments.

8. Capacity Planning: 

    Monitoring data assists in capacity planning by providing insights into resource utilization trends. This helps teams allocate resources efficiently to meet current and future demands.

9. Security Monitoring: 

    Beyond performance and reliability, monitoring also includes security aspects. Security monitoring involves detecting and responding to security threats and vulnerabilities in real-time.

10. Feedback Loop: 

    Monitoring is an integral part of the feedback loop in DevOps. Data from monitoring informs the development and operations teams about the impact of changes and improvements, enabling iterative development and continuous improvement.

Overall, monitoring is essential for achieving the goals of DevOps, which include faster delivery of high-quality software, better collaboration between teams, and continuous improvement of processes and systems. By proactively identifying and addressing issues, DevOps teams can ensure that applications and infrastructure meet the needs of users and the organization as a whole.


In monitoring we have Incidents, Alerts

incidents we have different levels

p1, p2, p3, p4

when comes to monitoring the key things

latency --> time for response, should be always low

traffic --> how many users are accessing our system

Errors --> 500, 503 these are from server side

Saturation --> benchmark, how many users can access with out any errors




ELK
------------------

E - stands for Elastic search

It is distributed database

L - logstash

filter the data coming from agents

K - Kibana

UI that connects to elasticsearch

filebeat or agents
------------------
filebeat can access log files and they can ship to elasticsearch...

install elk

send the logs through filebeat --> elasticsearch

send the logs from filebeat to logstash and then output
